    <h1>Pok√©mon - Mobile Development</h1>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
        Build a mobile app that uses a Pok√©mon API as its data source and tracks favorite Pok√©mon as global state.
        The application should "navigate" between views.
    </p>

    <h2>Screens</h2>
    <figure>
        <img src="./screens.png" alt="React Native app screens: home, detail, and favorite.">
        <figcaption>Home View, Detail View, and Favorite View</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <dl>
        <dt>Home View</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Lists Pok√©mon with the ability to page through them in sets of 20. (Start with an initial set of
                20 with no paging.) Use the Pok√©API to fetch Pok√©mon
                (<a href="https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon">https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon</a>.)
                See examples from <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">https://pokeapi.co/</a> to limit results to
                specific pages with <code>limit</code> and <code>offset</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Home View should navigate to the Detail View.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Home View can also navigate to the Favorite View.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Detail View</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Displays a single Pok√©mon with details including type and images.
                (Go as crazy with details as you like: movement, abilities, forms, evolutions...)
                Use <a href="https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon">https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon</a> with an id (Dex
                number) to fetch the full details of a Pok√©mon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Detail View should allow a user to mark the Pok√©mon as a "favorite"
                or remove the Pok√©mon as a favorite. (Toggle favorite.)
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Favorite View</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Displays favorite Pok√©mon in a quick summary format along with an image. Favorites are tracked
                with global state.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Favorite View should navigate to the Detail View.
            </p>
            <p>
                Optionally, the Favorite View should have a way to remove a favorite.
            </p>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a project for your given platform: Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, etc.<br>
            (There's a lot to this step. üòÑ Consult your learning path.)
        </li>
        <li>Start with the Home View. Don't worry about paging for now.</li>
        <li>Keep it simple. Don't go crazy with styles.</li>
        <li>Add the Detail View and navigate from the Home View, passing the Dex number as an argument. Keep the
            Detail View relatively simple.</li>
        <li>Add paging to the Home Screen.</li>
        <li>Implement the favorite toggle by tracking global state.</li>
        <li>Create a Favorite View.</li>
        <li>Navigate from the Home View to the Favorite View.</li>
        <li>Add more details: enrich the Details View, remove a favorite from the Favorite View, etc.</li>
        <li>Add more styling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add additional views that include abilities, moves, locations, berries, etc,
            based on the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2">Pok√©API</a>.</li>
        <li>Persist favorites permanently with a solution like Sqlite or some other local data store.</li>
        <li>Persist favorites permanently using an API!</li>
