    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>There are two players: Red and Blue.</li>
        <li>Players take turns. Blue starts.</li>
        <li>Each player has three shades of their color.</li>
        <li>The darkest, the initial corner, is the player's home. The object of the game is to destroy your opponent's home.
        </li>
        <li>Medium shade squares are active. A player selects one active square on their turn. (More below.)
        </li>
        <li>Light squares are inactive. They become active on a player's turn, after an active square is selected.</li>
        <li>When a player selects an active square, it "explodes". Effects:
            <ul>
                <li>The active square becomes empty.</li>
                <li>A ray of inactive squares shoots up, down, left, right, and in the four diagonal directions.</li>
                <li>Inactive square-rays stop when they hit an occupied square.</li>
                <li>If the occupied square is a barrier or the player's color, the ray stops.</li>
                <li>If the occupied square belongs to the opponent, the opponent's square is destroyed and becomes empty.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When a player hits their opponent's home square. They win.</li>
    </ul>
